0) Setup

Make sure python3 is installed and in the environment path.

pip3 install -r requirements.txt


1) Training

Model training is done by calling train.py, which then runs train and eval_model_new from methods.py.

Usage: python3 train.py [path to validation data] [optional: pretrained model name from models/ directory]

Example 1: python3 train.py data/test/XERS.csv
Example 2: python3 train.py data/test/XERS.csv model_500


2) Evaluation

Model evaluation is done by calling eval.py, which then runs eval_model_new from methods.py.

Usage: python3 eval.py [pretrained model name from models/ directory] [optional: minimum confidence to buy stock, -1 to initiate YOLO purchases where 100% of portfolio is used in each purchase]

Example 1: python3 eval.py model_500
Example 2: python3 eval.py model_500 .5

Note: there is also built-in stop loss capability, which can be accessed by changing the eval_model_new() call to include default argument SL = True. 


3) Trading

Using the model to trade is straightforward and can be done 2 ways. One way is by using input.py to search individual stocks and trade externally. The second way is by using trade.py to trade via alpaca.

Usage: python3 trade.py [optional: "trade" calls alpaca API to place trades] 

Example 1: python3 input.py
Example 2: python3 trade.py
Example 3: python3 trade.py trade
